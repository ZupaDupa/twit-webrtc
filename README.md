# WebRTC app for TWiT
==============

This is a WebRTC video calling app customized to be suitable for use in the [http://twit.tv/](TWiT.tv netcasting network).

##Features

* Shows a full screen remote video
* Does not show the local video
* Shows a little help/indicator text when not on a call
* Currently only works on Chrome

##TODO

* Only accept one participant and ignore other connections
* Test the support for different video aspect ratios
* Firefox support ([http://www.webrtc.org/interop](webrtc.org) has a list of API differences between Chrome and Firefox that need to be addressed)
* Maybe a control for toggling local video preview
